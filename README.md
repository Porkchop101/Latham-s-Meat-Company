     Latham's Restaurant README
=======================================

This website started off as a small idea in the back of a student's mind. I chose Latham's because there you can be treated like family and eat 
delicious food too.

Overview:

1. The restaurant was named after the owner, Mr. Paul Latham.
2. The logo was recreated to make the website look more clean.
3. We created our own favicon based off of the logo. Since we were working on a different computer, we didn't have the actual logo to make the favicon
   so we looked up flame images and used a favicon making website.
4. The fonts chosen were selected to make the website look more unique and easy to read in comparison to other barbeque restaurant
   websites.
5. The color scheme was chosen to resemble other barbeque restaurant websites, along with choosing colors that correspond with hunger.
6. As much as we tried, we could only get responsive on Gateway PCs and tablet devices. Our many attempts were not successful in trying for 
   mobile devices and larger screens. We did leave our attemps in our code.
7. We combined our skills in making this website great. Linsey brought creativness and the amazing form work, while Bree brought PHP and CSS code.
8. We used Linsey's e-mail for testing purposes in the PHP code. If the website is launched, we will change the e-mail to Mr. Latham's.
