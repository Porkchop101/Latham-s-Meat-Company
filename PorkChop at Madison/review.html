        <p> I am so thankful for Latham's. We had them cater our wedding and the food and drinks were very good. They even helped clean up the plates after people were finished eating, which they did not have too. It was so generous of them. Anytime my step mom or I called Latham's to communicate our order for the wedding day they were so nice and patient.
Thank you Latham's for making our wedding day amazing!</p>

        <p>One of my favorite places to stop for breakfast. They have the best biscuits and gravy and bacon is to die for and you should ask for double. You can never have enough bacon. I've seen people's breakfast orders of everything from tomato biscuits to BLTs to triple eggs for a pregnant wife and fried bologna. My husband loves the tenderloin and biscuits. They serve both breakfast lunch/dinner. You can drop in for a rack or ribs or a half chicken or even bologna sandwich. They also have a great fresh meat counter with everything you could need from pork and chicken to beef. Their filets and bacon wrapped filet kabobs are my favorites. They are well known for their pulled pork BBQ and they have great deals for an easy family dinner with all the sides. Highly recommend and hope they remain long and strong as a staple for Jackson.</p>

        <p>I love Lathams all around! Warning: Don't go here if you're on a diet. Their portions are very large, very flavorful, and naturally pretty fatty. The ribs are probably the best I've had anywhere. They don't come with any sauce on them, which I like because they don't need it. The hickory smoked flavor speaks for itself. Oh, and if you're looking for a great sandwich there, the BLT is a sure winner as well. They literally put 7 or 8 strips of bacon on each sandwich along with two thick slices locally grown tomatoes and fresh lettuce. Very delicious! Staff that works here is very southern charming as well.</p>

        <p>You've had bbq here and there but if you haven't been to Latham's you are missing out. When you drive up, look out towards the back of the building on the left side. Yessir that's hickory burning and plenty of it. That's how real bbq is done and Latham's does it right. 
The bbq is tender juicy and will melt in your mouth. 
Lunch plates, ribs, bbq bologna, pulled pork bbq, bbq sandwiches, Cole slaw. Hungry yet? Then there's also the butcher shop inside where you can get slab bacon, steaks, chops, fresh country sausage. Hungry yet? Eat here!</p>

        <p>If you are ever in Jackson Tenn you must try the ribs here at this place they are mouth watering and you can pull the meat off the bones with your fingers. It's so good it needs no sauce!! It was recommended by the hotel. I was skeptical, because it was empty when I walked in, however after sampling the ribs I was in heaven!! If you want real Barbeque this is your place!!</p>

        <p>Great food, fair price and friendly staff. This is my kids favorite place for breakfast. If it's just me and my daughter I'll get bacon eggs and a biscuit the portions are so huge it'll feed us both. The restaurant is very unassuming and a haunt for older gentle men to congregate, a place to take you family and feel good about it.</p>
